  <h1>ROI Trace Selection v0.21.0<br />User Guide</h1>

  <div class="date">2nd August, 2022</div>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Common imaging protocols using fluorescent dyes, such as that described in
    <a href="#ref:cousin2008use">Cousin (2008)</a> require the selection of
    numerical fluorescence traces during the data analysis stage. This web tool
    is designed to assist in selection of Regions of Interest (ROIs) which
    conform to expected behaviour. It should make the trace selection data
    preprocessing stage of ROI analysis slightly less painful. The tool provides
    a simple graph visualisation of a full set of time series traces. The
    user may then select or deselect individual traces, scale and offset the
    traces, and then output the results in CSV format. Additionally, as traces
    tend to follow an expected pattern for a given dataset, traces which do not
    follow this behaviour can be automatically excluded. These patterns are
    specified as percentage drops or increases in value within a given
    frame interval, the percentage being of the total value drop or
    increase. For example, select those traces which exhibit a 20% drop in
    value between frames 18 and 20, which corresponds with the time a
    large stimulus was applied during the assay.
  </p>

  <h2>Running the tool</h2>

  <p>Simply go to
    <a href="https://demonsoft.org/neuroscience/trace-selector"
      target="_blank">https://demonsoft.org/neuroscience/trace-selector</a>. You should see the tool running as in
    <a href="#fig:initialView">Figure 1</a>. The tool runs entirely in your browser, and no CSV data is transferred from
    your device.

  </p>

  <h2>Opening a data file</h2>

  <div class="describe-image">
    <img class="inline-image" src="./images/loadChannel1.png" />
    <p>Clicking on the <span class="command">Open</span> button will show a file
      select window. Pick your input data file in CSV format. Currently the tool
      expects the data to be in structure shown in Table
      <a href="#table:inputFormat">Table 1</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

    <caption>
      Table 1: Expected input data structure
    </caption>
  </table>

  <p> The values are expected to be in order of individual traces in columns,
    and frames in rows. The first row contains the trace names, and the first
    column contains the frame indices (although these are always expected to be
    1,2,3,4...). There are no other rows or columns apart from the trace values
    expected, although any mean or total value columns may be deselected later.
    If there are problems with parsing the data file, the tool will attempt to
    display as much of the data as possible, and give a warning. Users are
    recommended to fix problems with the input data file and reload before
    continuing. Once the file is selected, the tool will plot all traces in the
    chart.</p>

  <div class="describe-image">
    <img class="inline-image" src="./images/openExampleData.png" />
    <p>To see the tool in action with some example data, click the <span class="command">Open Example Data</span>
      button.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Dual channel mode</h2>

  <div class="describe-image">
    <img class="inline-image" src="./images/loadChannel2.png" />
    <p> Some datasets have two channels, each with a CSV file. This tool allows
      traces from both channels to be viewed simultaneously, and trace selections
      will apply to both channels. To use two channel mode, open the first channel
      CSV file with <span class="command">Open</span>, then click on the
      <span class="command">Channel 2</span> tab and open the second channel CSV
      file with <span class="command">Open</span>. The
      CSV files must have matching trace names, trace counts and frame counts.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Frame Markers</h2>

  <p> The user can add markers to guide interpretation of the results, for example
    drug addition at frame number <i>x</i>, stimulation at frame number <i>y</i>. The
    currently created frame markers are listed, and can be added to or removed
    (see <a href="#fig:frameMarkerControls">Figure 2</a>). Example frame markers are shown on the chart in <a
      href="#fig:markersOnChart">Figure 3</a> </p>

  <div class="figure">

    <img src="./images/markersOnChart.png" />
    <div class="caption">Figure 3: Example frame markers</div>
  </div>

  <h2>Aligning the traces</h2>

  <p> The <span class="command">Alignment</span> section of the tool can
    offset the values to a common start value, and additionally
    scale all the traces to a common end value. Selecting
    <span class="command">Align trace maxima</span>
    enables the offset to start value. The user can either pick a start frame to
    align to, or align all traces on each of their maximum values (see
    <a href="#fig:alignMaxima">Figure 4</a>).
  </p>

  <div class="figure">
    <a id="fig:alignMaxima"></a>
    <img src="./images/alignMaxima.png" />
    <div class="caption">Figure 4: Aligned trace maxima</div>
  </div>

  <p> Selecting
    <span class="command">Align trace minima</span> enables the
    scale to end value. Again, the user can either pick an end frame to align
    to, or align all traces on each of their minimum values (see
    <a href="#fig:alignMinima">Figure 5</a>).
  </p>

  <div class="figure">
    <a id="fig:alignMinima"></a>
    <img src="./images/alignMinima.png" />
    <div class="caption">Figure 5: Aligned trace maxima and minima</div>
  </div>

  In both cases, the user may pick the value to align
  to.</p>

  <h2>Trace selection</h2>

  <p> The main purpose of the tool is to allow easy removal of outlier traces.
    To do this, the user may either select traces manually, or filter them
    automatically with a threshold filter. To start, select the
    <span class="command">Trace Selection</span> panel on the left. The user can
    manually select traces based on simple inspection. As in many cases, traces are
    manually identified by sharing common behaviour such as a sharp change in
    value at a particular frame interval (corresponding with a particular
    event occurring during data recording), the tool also allows for auto
    selection of traces on this basis. In dual channel mode, the user can choose
    which of the channels to use for automatic trace selection.
  </p>

  <h3>Manual selection</h3>

  <p> The traces selection list on the right of the
    charts shows which traces are currently selected or deselected (see
    <a href="#fig:selectTrace">Figure 6</a>). Clicking on a
    particular trace will cycle through marking the trace as selected, deselected or undecided.
  </p>

  <p>The trace selection list can also be navigated using
    the keyboard. The user can
    move up or down with the arrow keys and select or deselect the currently
    highlighted trace with the spacebar.</p>

  <div class="figure">
    <a id="fig:selectTrace"></a>
    <img src="./images/selectTrace.png" />
    <div class="caption">Figure 6: Manual trace selection</div>
  </div>


  <p> The traces on the charts will change colour
    depending on their selection status (see <a href="#table:traceColours">Table 2</a>).</p>

  <table class="trace-colours">
    <a id="table:traceColours"></a>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Trace colour</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th><span style="color:#a40000">Red</span></th>
        <td>Trace deselected</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Black</th>
        <td>Trace selection not decided</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><span style="color:navy">Blue</span></th>
        <td>Trace selected</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    <caption>
      Table 2: Trace colours in trace chart
    </caption>
  </table>


  <div class="describe-image">
    <img class="inline-image" src="./images/selectionCounts.png" />
    <p>Above the list the number of
      currently selected traces is shown, here for example 25 deselected, 68 selected and 3 undecided.</p>
  </div>




  <div class="describe-image">
    <img class="inline-image" src="./images/currentSelectionIcons.png" />
    <p>These icons show the selection state of the current trace; unselected, undecided, or selected. Clicking on these
      icons will also change the selection.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="describe-image">
    <img class="inline-image" src="./images/selectAll.png" />
    <p>The button at the top of the list allows the user to select, unselect or clear all selections.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="describe-image">
    <img class="inline-image" src="./images/traceCountRemaining.png" />
    <p>This button shows the number of traces that have not yet been decided. Clicking on it will choose the next
      undecided trace in the list.</p>
  </div>






  <h3>Percentage Change Selection</h3>

  <p> Selecting <span class="command">% Change</span> will
    cause the chart to show a blue marker signifying the frame interval
    over which the value change will take place. Use the
    <span class="command">Start frame</span> and
    <span class="command">End frame</span> entries to adjust this frame
    interval. Then, one can set the
    <span class="command">% of total change</span> to filter the traces. For
    example, if a trace had a total value range of 1000 units, and the
    <span class="command">% of total change</span> was set to 20%, then the trace
    would need to have changed in value at least 200 units between the
    start and end of the chosen frame interval to be selected (see
    <a href="#fig:percentChangeSelection">Figure 7</a>).
  </p>

  <div class="figure">
    <a id="fig:percentChangeSelection"></a>
    <img src="./images/percentChangeSelection.png" />
    <div class="caption">
      Figure 7: Percentage change selection
    </div>
  </div>

  <p> After doing this auto selection, the final selection can still be adjusted
    by selecting or deselecting traces manually as
    described above.</p>

  <h3>Standard Deviation Threshold Selection</h3>

  <p> In some cases traces are only of interest if their trace values vary a given
    amount from their mean. The standard deviation threshold selection option
    allows this. Selecting
    <span class="command">STDEV</span> allows the user to
    specify two frame regions in the chart (see
    <a href="#fig:stdevSelection">Figure 8</a>). The
    <span class="command">baseline</span> region (highlighted in green on the
    chart) defines the region of each trace to use to calculate the mean and
    standard deviation. All trace measurements and selection are done
    individually, with each trace being independent of the rest. The
    <span class="command">detection</span> region (highlighted in blue on the
    chart) defines the region to check for distance from the mean. Finally
    <span class="command">STDEV minimum multiple</span> allows the user to
    define how much variance from the mean is required for trace selection.
  </p>

  <div class="figure">
    <a id="fig:stdevSelection"></a>
    <img src="./images/stdevSelection.png" />
    <div class="caption">
      Figure 8: Standard deviation selection
    </div>
  </div>

  <p> For example, if the mean and standard deviation of a particular trace
    was 4.0 and 2.0 in the baseline region, and the
    <span class="command">STDEV minimum multiple</span> was set to 1.5, then the
    selection threshold would be set at 2.0 x 1.5 = 3.0 from the mean. The trace
    will be selected only if at least one of its values in the detection region
    is either &gt; 7.0 or &lt; 1.0.
  </p>

  <p> Again, after doing this auto selection, the final selection can still be
    adjusted manually.</p>

  <h3>Outlier Removal Selection</h3>

  <p> Selecting <span class="command">Remove Outliers</span> allows
    the user to specify how many traces to select, and the tool will pick the
    subset of the available traces which produces the minimum standard deviation (see
    <a href="#fig:removeOutliersSelection">Figure 9</a>).
  </p>

  <p>Note this option is computationally intensive, so may take some time to respond to changes in the trace count.</p>

    <a id="fig:removeOutliersSelection"></a>
    <img src="./images/removeOutliersSelection.png" />
    <div class="caption">

    </div>
  </div>


  <h2>Single trace selection mode</h2>

  <div class="describe-image">
    <img class="inline-image" src="./images/fullscreenIcon.png" />
    <p>To minimise user bias during manual selection, single trace selection mode
      displays only a single trace at a time. The user can select or deselect that
      trace without any visual comparison with the other traces in the dataset (see
      <a href="#fig:fullscreenMode">Figure 10</a>). To
      choose this mode, click on the <span class="command">Fullscreen</span> button. Clicking on the button again will
      return to normal mode.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="figure">
    <a id="fig:fullscreenMode"></a>
    <img src="./images/fullscreenMode.png" />
    <div class="caption">
      Figure 10: Single trace selection
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Saving data files</h2>

  <div class="describe-image">
    <img class="inline-image" src="./images/saveAsIcon.png" />
    <p> Clicking on the <span class="command">Save as</span> button save the
      currently selected traces in CSV format. The data
      will be saved using the displayed alignment and scaling values. Note that it
      is possible to perform the trace selection, then uncheck the alignment and
      scaling options, to allow saving of the original data values of only
      the selected traces. In dual channel mode, the channels may be saved
      separately.</p>
  </div>
