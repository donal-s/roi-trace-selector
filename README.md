## Testing Strategy

The model classes are unit tested, while the react components are tested in isolation, but using the real model classes to see the real effects of events.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
